 for a basic overview :

basically its an online chatbot based ticket booking system that mainly commits in booking digital tickets using voice commands for the user efficiently, has multilingual support (just english,bengali & hindi is implemented till now)
it also has text features for efficient typing experience too..
Proper ANC hardware features for implementing noise cancellation using advanced DSP algorithms.
updates to be made very soon..still under working but hardware isn't implemented yet ..trying my best to do so as I made this in 5 days ..
basic working features in terms of voice is working fine still has some loopholes which is to be fixed soon .

thank you
